You need to install the rabbitmq and postgres and also you need set the necessary variables in the .env.development file.

To install the package use command => "npm install"
To start the server use command => "npm run dev" (It uses nodemon)
If you do not have nodemon installed then use this command => "npm build" and then "npm start"
